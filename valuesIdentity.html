                <h3>Core Values</h3>
                <p>
                    I see how my own values drive my relationships, my success and my decisions. These values encase my
                    own identity so lets dive right on in and get to know me…
                    <ul>
                        <li>Empathy</li>
                        <li>Courage</li>
                        <li>Honesty</li>
                        <li>Acceptance</li>
                        <li>Forgiveness</li>
                        <li>Connectedness</li>
                        <li>Humility</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorry I had trouble shortening this list…..
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Aotearoa i’ve grown up is filled with people who accept the differences and choices of others
                    and enjoying simple pleasures and experiences. I know that because of this I have been extremely
                    lucky. I grew up with a dad that only shops at secondhand clothing stores and has biked to work
                    everyday for 45 years. A mother who has worked as a nurse both in her professional and personal
                    life, constantly sacrificing for the people around her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have grown up in a family where the
                    culture is unconditional love, acceptance and courage, where what we were was always enough.
                </p>

                <h3>Ethical decision making</h3>
                <p>
                    Living in a society littered with hypocrisy, the values I associate with are challenged everyday.

                    The decision I feel confronts me most often is the attitude and mindset towards consumption. What we
                    consume and how we consume it. Every time I hop in the car, hell every item I purchase almost any
                    item, food, clothing…. it’s a big f**k you to the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of my upbringing and privilege one ethical decision I have made and continue to make
                    each day is to bike or walk as a primary means of
                    transport.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Originally making this decision I thought about the extra time and effort needed to get around. I
                    realised beyond turning up sweaty to all future social engagements it was really no real sacrifice
                    at
                    all it just requiring slightly better organisation on my part and some comfy shoes.
                </p>
                <h3>Strengths, limitations, future obstacles</h3>
                <p>
                    I think my main strengths in a working environment are being kind and open, determined, logical and
                    easy going. My main limitations in a work environment are feeling like a burden. I can take things too
                    personally and not ask for help when I know it’s needed. I’m also a rubbish public speaker :)   
                </p>
                <p> I can see how being too easy going, I may forfeit opportunities to extend myself in this programme
                    and I’ll have to work on the public speaking side of things. I know how important it is to be able to
                    communicate ideas, successes, failures and ask for help. These are a few of my goals to work on
                    while at dev and beyond the programme.
                </p>
                <h3>Overcoming past obstacles</h3>
                <p>
                    In my last place of work as an accountant I received a lot of resistance from the CEO who didn’t
                    like dealing with numbers. She was all about doing it on the fly, no plan and figuring it out as we go,
                    as a conservative decision maker this was really hard for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually we discussed how we could better communicate the financial aspects of the company performance so i could feel heard and she could
                    feel informed. We decided to implement a more visual approach to the interaction and this really improved
                    our communication and the quality of the decision making.
