                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence</h3>
                <p>
                    Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive emotions, reason with and understand these
                    emotions and then manage the emotions. Having this control over your own though processes and
                    feelings leads to better, more reasoned decision making for yourself. Using these skills to
                    understand others emotions will lead to greater success in your all of your relationships.
                </p>
                <h3> How is EQ different to IQ</h3>
                <p>
                    EQ is the emotional understanding and responsiveness of a person whereas IQ is the standardised
                    assessment of a persons academic abilities. Intellectual intelligence is easier to quantify but is
                    becoming less popular as a means to predict a persons success. “A high IQ will get you through
                    school, a high EQ will get you through life.”
                </p>
                <h3> Is EQ important</h3>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence is so important in both a personal and professional environment. The
                    qualities of empathy, fully giving another your attention, and mastery over your emotions is the
                    perfect formula for building meaningful connections and happinesss within yourself and ythose around
                    you. EQ helps to make decisions that are both feeling driven and logically sound.
