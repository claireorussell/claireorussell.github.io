                <h3>The differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    Using a house for this analogy, the html is the contents you own that make up the house from your
                    items to the foundational aspects. The css is the styling to the contents in the house.The colour of
                    the walls, the carpet feel, the colour and shape of your desk.
                    There can be html without css but there can never be css without html as there would be nothing to
                    style.
                </p>
                <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
                <p>
                    Control flow is the order that your code executes, and a loop is a statement that will continue
                    repeating until the condition you give it is met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of this is ‘when do i need to shower’ there are different reasons (conditions) for
                    needing a shower. We loop through the condition of being ‘unclean’ on which to execute , ‘did you
                    bike from work’ If yes (true) the execution is ‘you will need to shower’. If not you could run
                    through another condition asking will you have time to shower in the morning before work. If the
                    answer to this was no you would shower now. The stopping point for the loop would be needing to
                    shower at least once from the time you get home to when you leave home the next day.
                </p>
                <h3>The DOM and how you interact with it</h3>
                <p>
                    The DOM (Document Object Model) is an object representation of your html document. We can add,
                    change, manipulate elements in html by representing them as nodes in the DOM and adding values and
                    function to the object using Javascript.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                An example of interaction with the DOM is adding an event to an element in your html.
                The code to do this is: <strong>addEventListner()</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This method will wait for something to happen, we call this an event. It may clicking on a button
                    and the reaction to this will be that the display changes colour.
                </p>
                <h3> Accessing data from arrays && objects</h3>
                <p>
                    Data in an array has items that are associated to a variable and can be accessed by their index. An
                    index starts counting at zero so the first item on your list will be index [0] the second index [1]
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of an array is var coffee = [true, 2, “milk”, “yum”]
                </p>
                <p>
                    To access the value “milk” in the array you would call on the property; coffee[2] and the output
                    would be “milk”. Although your array is built of different types of values, number, string, boolean
                    you call on each data type in the same way using the index.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objects store data in a list, each item has a property key and a value assigned to that property.
                    You call on the value by passing in the variable and the property.
                </p>
                <p>An example of an object is
                    <p>
                        var coffee = { <br>
                        “need a coffee”: “true” ,<br>
                        “number of coffees”: “2”, <br>
                        “extras”: “milk”,<br>
                        “taste”: “Yum”<br>
                    </p>
                    To access the value milk in the object you call on the property; coffee.extras and the output would
                    be “milk”.
                </p>
                <h3> Funtions and their use</h3>
                <p>
                    Functions are used in your code to perform a specific task or find a value. We use a set of
                    statements to define what we want our function to do and then this code will run as many times as we
                    tell it to.
                    Functions are so useful for reusability, which means you can call on the same function is other
                    areas of your programme and not have to write out the same line of code, you write it jus the once
                    and reuse it. This therefore condenses your code and makes it more readable and less complex.
