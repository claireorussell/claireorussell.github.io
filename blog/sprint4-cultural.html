                <h3>What is Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    Neuroplasticity is the understanding that your brain is a muscle - the more you work it, the
                    stronger it is! Like plastic it changes shape as you grow. The more you learn the greater your
                    pathways become within your brain to recognise and retrieve these learnings and the faster they
                    become with engaging to new ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The growth mindet is about believeing your abilities are not fixed. Just as Neuroplasticity states
                    your brain is always changing and will become stronger, more capable as you use it.
                    The mindset is the understanding that your intellegience is not fixed, that you become more
                    academically capable the more you learn and 'use your brain'.
                    Having this understanding also makes it easier to learn, you have greater resilience when you
                    struggle and you enjoy the process of learning, the small successes.
                </p>

                <h3>How I can engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for my own benefit </h3>
                <p>
                    Repeating activities and reviewing concepts until the activity seems easier. Review is particularly
                    important as you can continue to strengthen the pathways in your brain without actually doing an
                    exercise simply thinking about what the different concepts are and how they can be used.
                    Positive thinking- imagining myself solving the problem, this mindset will then become associated
                    with the learning.
                </p>

                <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                <p>
                    it was a nice reminder as we get deeper into Javascript that it will all come together, just have to
                    be consistent.
                </p>
                <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                <p>
                    I will do a few hours in the weekend just for reviewing, not attempting any new challenges or
                    concepts but to have a look over what we covered and it’s how it’s used.
                </p>
