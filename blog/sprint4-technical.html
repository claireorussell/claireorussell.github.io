                <h3>That time I got stuck && that time I solved it </h3>
                <p>
                    I got stuck on the FizzBuzz challenge. I was trying to return a value to my array during the looping
                    process. When you’re in a loop it runs the condition and the iteration and then if it has a ‘return’
                    statement the looping process stops. For example if you’re looping through an array of four it will
                    only ‘loop’ through the first variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To problem solve this issue I looked back at my pseudocode, console.logged, googled and then asked
                    for help. As soon as the helper looked at my code they explained why you can’t return in that
                    situation and said I needed to find another way around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process felt good, I really felt I had exhausted all of my ideas before asking for help but
                    wasn’t yet frustrated and I was glad when it was a small error and one that I can understand the
                    reason behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I honestly couldn’t tell you if any of the code I’ve written has been elegant. I’m so happy if the
                    code is readable, and works!!!
                </p>


                <h3> in problem solving techniques and process</h3>
                <p>
                    <h5>Pseudocode </h5>
                    I love Pseudocode, the longer I read, wrote about and planned what the question really
                    wanted and my own answer the easier it was to get the answer, close to right, first time. Also a
                    great tool to look back at when your code isn’t working yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Trying something</h5>One challenge I did use a method I had googled to find and it worked
                    perfectly,
                    sometimes knowing what you need it to do is enough, and knowing how it’s doing it doesn’t matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5> I’m embarrassingly all for the rubber ducky. I love talking problems
                    out loud,
                    I’ll often have a light bulb moment doing this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Reading error messages</h5> Error messages can be confusing but for the most part they always
                    point you
                    in the right direction, I’m pretty confident reading them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Console.logging</h5> Super useful technique to see where about you’re losing your code.
                    Especially when
                    the error messages don’t make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Googling</h5> I like googling but Im not always confident in how to ask the right question in
                    the right
                    way. There is so much information on the same types of topics, you have to be so specific.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5> I don’t particularly like doing this over slack or even zoom. I
                    really
                    only like doing it in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5> My coach is awesome, good at giving direction without giving you
                    the
                    answer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5> I have one page left in my reflection pad, i really
                    see the
                    value in reflecting on what you learnt, it definitely makes things clearer for me.
