        <h3>Introduction to topic</h3>
        <p>
            The first important concept to understand about any webpage is that every element on a web page, the title,
            the images the paragraphs are all treated in blocks. Try to imagine a border enclosing each element on the
            web page as a way to keep them separated so they can be styled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without any display styling each box of content on your page would sit one on top of the other in a vertical
            line which is called block display and is the default styling.
            To position content as we want it to appear on screen we add a value to the display styling of its element.
            Inline and inline block are two of these display options.
        </p>
        <h3>The image below represents the three display options.</h3>

        <h3>Display option explained</h3>
        <p>
            Inline display will position each box with it’s contents in a horizontal line one after the other and always
            to the width of the contents inside. Inline display is best used as the display for a sentence or paragraph
            of text where you want to highlight one phrase with different italics or highlight a section of the
            paragraph. Inline display ignores the following values when associated to the element;
            <ul>
                <li>height or weight values</li>
                <li>padding and margin values on the top and bottom of the element</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
           Inline block display will position each box with it’s content side-by-side much the same as Inline display.
            The difference is that it will account for extra values such as height associated to the element. When you
            add extra styling such as a padding around the content, the box will account for this and increase the white
            space between contents and the box border by the padding indicated. This option will also account for
            wrapping, when the row can fit no more boxes on it will automatically wrap underneath in the appropriate
            margin spacing indicated.
        </p>
        <h3>So what does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h3>
        <p>
            Do you need to be able to change the height, width, top or bottom padding? choose inline blocks, if not
            inline it is.
