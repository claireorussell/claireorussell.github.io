                <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
                    learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    I like routine. I can think more clearly if i relax, getting out and starting my day with exercise
                    and that being a set routine helps me to relax and have a more productive day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a pretty positive inner-voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That even those with a high EQ need to understand what that is to be use it as a tool for your own
                    and others success.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming is a team sport and you have to understand and embrace others for who they are. a
                    comfotale and inclusive environment is the only way to have consistent success as a team.
                </p>

                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    Nothing really surprised me but I did enjoy it, mostly talking about it with other people.
                </p>

                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    The writing.
                </p>

                <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a
                    web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because this industry is traditionally viewed as a very insular environment and in practice it is
                    very much a collaborative environment and to get a job in this industry you need to be able to
                    someone who enhances a business and itâ€™s internal culture not turn it into a one- wo/man show.
                </p>

                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just
                    used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>
                    No, I enjoyed it and it broke the work up a bit.
