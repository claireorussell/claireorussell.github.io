                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    I don’t know exactly where i want to be or exactly what I want to be doing but my goal is simply to
                    enjoy the work and workspace i enter into, to always be learning and to live by the ocean.
                    My ideal career would be dynamic collaborative and in an ethical field I can be passionate about.
                </p>
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I think at the moment most of my strengths are non technical. I know i’m a good listener and i
                    generally facilitate good communication and energy within a group or team. I have a fairly
                    live-and-let-live attitude, i’m also usually flexible, open minded, logical, resilient and
                    passionate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main weaknesses are around feeling like a burden. I can take things too personally and not ask
                    for help when I know it’s needed as I never want to disrupt anyone else's time and energy. I’m also
                    a rubbish public speaker :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Going forward in this study I would like to work towards developing greater collaboration skills,
                    let go of the idea that I am burdening others with my existence/questions and the ability to
                    confidently public speak. Basically my main weaknesses.
                </p>

                <h3>Commitments and success</h3>
                <p>
                    I am fully committed to this course!
                    In terms of workload I am fairly good at prioritising and have been writing my goals and structure
                    for the day/week down at the beginning of each print and doing my best to meet those commitments. I
                    feel it makes me accountable for my own experience and good for reflecting both during each sprint
                    and as each sprint ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working with other people and in teams is exciting for me so I think I will enjoy the collaboorative
                    nature of this programme. Developing the skills to collaborate effectively and ensure the success of
                    each team i’m in will be a priority for me.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I’m lucky enough to have a partner who has completed dev academy and checks in with me everyday
                    after work This gives me the opportunity to ask any questions I have and seek guidance. My
                    facilitator has also made it super clear I can ask questions at any time and this is really
                    important to me. I may not have been too stuck yet but i really appreciate the offer of open
                    communication because i know the hard stuff is quickly approaching!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me success at dev academy will be enjoying my time learning something completely new and
                    developing new and existing skills. From facilitators I only expect i’m encouraged to be curious and
                    find my own success within the team and work we complete. Also hoping my questions are answered
                    ‘kindly’ no matter how un-thought out they are :)
